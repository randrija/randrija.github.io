      <font face = "Comic Sans MS" size =" 5"> The first thing in Computer Science we did was play the Lightbot game.

      <font face = "Comic Sans MS" size =" 5"> This is my Interactive Fiction project that I did with my partner Christina. It starts in North Korea on a citizen named Mal-Chin who decides he wants to go to America and try the In-N-Out burger. The player has to make desicions that either evade him from capture or furthur his progress in getting the burger.
